I met a traveller from an antique land,
/imagine prompt: Hand-Drawn, traveller, from an antique land, who said, meeting, parchment sketch

Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,
Hand-Drawn, Two vast and trunkless legs of stone, desert, parchment sketch

Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Hand-Drawn, Half sunk in sand, shattered visage, parchment sketch, frown, wrinkled lip, sneer of cold command, desert
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Hand-Drawn, two people, one an ancient sculptor, the other a cruel king sitting for him as a model, parchment sketch

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
/imagine Hand-Drawn, two people, one an ancient sculptor, the other a king sitting for him as a model, parchment sketch
And on the pedestal, these words appear:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
/imagine prompt: Hand-Drawn, pedestal, words appear: "My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!", ancient lost language

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”
/imagine prompt: Hand-Drawn, Nothing beside remains, Round the decay of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare, The lone and level sands stretch far away, desert, parchment drawing
